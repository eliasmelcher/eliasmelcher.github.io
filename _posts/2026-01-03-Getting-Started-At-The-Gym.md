## Getting Started at the Gym

### My Journey to the Gym

A short time ago, I was as far from a gym-goer as possible.  My social life was in tatters, my girlfriend and I had split, and my dog passed away.  All I wanted to do was lie in bed all day and stare at my phone.  After a few days of this, I was reaching my breaking point.  I wasn't eating properly, barely saw my friends, and was getting no work done.  I decided to go to the gym the next morning.
 
I set my alarm for eight, got a quick breakfast, and hit the gym by nine.  And I am so glad I did.  I have been working out consistently ever since.

The gym was rather scary at first.  As a socially anxious dude, gyms can be a minefield of anxieties.  I'll admit I'd have panic attacks there in my first few days.  But I started to realize something.  There was always someone doing something goofier than me.  There was always someone stronger than me. 

This is a concept that flies over a lot of people's heads.  No one is paying attention to you at the gym because you aren't that interesting.  A lot of guys show up expecting to be the strongest, or to become the strongest, only to find this task insurmountable.  There's always going to be someone who's been going for years or is blasting steroids who you simply cannot compete with.  So don't worry about it.  Focus on yourself.

And a lot of people worry that they'll do the exercise wrong and get made fun of or whatever.  I remember when I first started doing RDLs, I had terrible form.  I still do, I hate doing these.  But someone came up to me and helped me correct my form a bit.  People at the gym want to help you.  No one's judging you  because we all used to be there.  Another time, I saw someone dancing in front of the mirror with weights in their hands.  So no matter how bad your form looks, someone's always doing something weirder.

And this takes time to realize, I understand, but if you keep this in mind, the gym will seem a lot less scary.

It's also good to have the right expectations.  If you're looking to get buff, remember that the gym is all about slow, incremental progress.  Don't expect to look strong after a week, a month, or even a few months.  It took me nearly a year to start looking buff.  If you go in with the expectation of instantly gaining Greek god aesthetics, you're not going to have a good time. 

Don't expect to enjoy the gym at first, either.  The first two weeks are going to feel like shit.  If you can push through those, it'll get a lot better.  You will be in pain a lot.  Every day tasks like going up stairs may be difficult at first.  But it is so worth it.  The pain and soreness go away quickly, but the benefits last forever.  We'll discuss how to deal with these first two weeks in a later post, but keep this in mind for your first session.

Finally, remember that you're at the gym for you.  Don't go there to get girls, or whatever, as a lot of guys do.  In fact, never ask a girl out at the gym.  That's a stupid idea.  And don't work out purely to get more babes.  You're not gonna enjoy working out if your goal is external validation.  Workout for you.  It's good for your health.  It boosts your immune system, makes you think clearly, helps with emotional stability, depression, anxiety, and anger, and is an awesome time.  I look forward to going to the gym every day and have seen it help my life in so many ways.  It got me out of bed every morning for a while.  It got me new friends later.  And now, it keeps me sane.  I'll see you guys at the gym!
